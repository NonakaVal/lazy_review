The lecture on "machine learning" discussed various techniques and methods in the field. Machine learning is described as a rapidly growing data-driven technical field at the intersection of computer science and statistics, serving as the core of artificial intelligence and data science. It is widely applied across science, technology, and commerce fields, leading to evidence-based decision-making in various industries. Machine learning algorithms have the ability to "learn" without explicit programming, improving through experience and learning algorithms.

Tom M. Mitchell's definition of learning from experience is highlighted, emphasizing the application of machine learning in building energy systems since the late 1990s. It is widely used in load prediction, control and operation, fault detection, and diagnostics. The lecture also mentioned the exploration of knowledge in the machine learning process and the development of algorithms for different application scenarios.

Advanced supporting techniques such as clustering, data augmentation, and active learning techniques are discussed as part of the machine learning process. In terms of performance, various machine learning algorithms were observed in building load prediction, including Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), Deep Learning, Tree-based Algorithms, Hybrid Algorithms, Autoregressive methods, and more. The development and trend of machine learning algorithms in building load prediction were also summarized, showing a combination of traditional algorithms with clustering, parameter optimization, rule-based modeling, and other data-driven algorithms to increase prediction accuracy.
